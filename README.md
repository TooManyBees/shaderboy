# shaderboy

[Shaderboy](https://www.toomanybees.com/shaderboy/) is a live glsl coding environment, a la
[editor.thebookofshaders.com](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com), but also uses your device's camera for face tracking,
and sends the coordinates of facial landmarks to the fragment shader.

So, like, shoot lasers out your eyes. Or hypno-waves, whatever.

It is, uh, not intended to be portable in older browsers. Sorry, but now that I got a taste of `<script type="module">`
I don't need no bundler or babel anymore.
